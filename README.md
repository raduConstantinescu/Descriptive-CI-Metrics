## Linting
PyLint is a widely used tool for checking code quality and enforcing coding standards in Python projects. With the PyLint configuration file added to the project, linting the project becomes easy and ensures that all contributors adhere to the same coding standards.

To lint the Python project with PyLint, follow these steps:
1. Install PyLint by running the following command: `pip install pylint`
2. Navigate to the root of the project directory.
3. Run PyLint on the project by executing the following command: `pylint --rcfile=.pylintrc **/*.py`
